Multiple camera setup
---------------------
Cameras will drift after while, action cameras are almost always not syncable and even if it's difficult to realize a synchoniziation unterwater with a low budget, a drift overtime might not be issue if there is one reference frame in the beginning.

* in order to synchronize the feed of multiple cameras a significant audio signal might be used once or from time to time.
